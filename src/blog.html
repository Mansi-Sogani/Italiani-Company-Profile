                    <p>Internet of Things examples extend from smart connected homes to wearables to healthcare. In fact, IoT is slowly becoming part of every aspect of our lives. Not only are Internet of Things applications enhancing our comfort, but they also give us more control to simplify routine work life and personal tasks.
                        The recent hype about our IoT future has forced companies to consider the basic building blocks for the Internet of Things—i.e., hardware, software and support—to enable developers to deploy applications that can connect anything within IoT’s scope.
                        We know the potential of IoT markets is huge, but some domains will mature more quickly than the rest. Here are Internet of Things application areas that have the potential for exponential growth.
                        <br><b>Smart Homes:</b> A smart home is one in which devices have the capability to communicate with each other, as well as with their environment and the Internet. Smart homes enable owners to customize and control their home environments for increased security and efficient energy management. There are already hundreds of IoT technologies available to monitor and build smart homes.<br>
                        <b>Wearables: </b>Wearables are one of the hottest trends in IoT Apple, Samsung, Jawbone and plenty of others are joining the cut-throat competition.<br>
                        <b>Retail: </b>The potential of IoT in the retail sector is enormous. Imagine if your home appliances could notify you when supplies are short and order them all on their own. This proximity-based advertising model of smart retailing is becoming a reality. We already have Internet of Things application examples through smart supply chains. Applications for tracking goods, real-time inventory information exchange among suppliers and retailers, and automated delivery capabilities exist and new growth areas are emerging quickly.<br>
                        <b>Smart Cities: </b>Smart surveillance, safer and automated transportation, smarter energy management systems and environmental monitoring are all examples of IoT applications for smart cities. Smart cities have real, substantial solutions for complications that arise due to population surges, pollution, poor infrastructure and energy supply shortages. Here are some examples of IoT devices at work in smart cities.<br>
                        <b>Health Care: </b>UroSense is a smart fluid management solution offered by Future Path Medical. It automatically measures the core body temperature (CBT) and urine output of patients on catheterization. The smart monitoring of these vital signs helps avoid infections while starting early care of medical conditions like diabetes, prostate cancer, heart failure and sepsis. UroSense can wirelessly provide report data directly to nursing stations anywhere.<br>
                        <b>Agriculture: </b>The Phenonet Project is designed to help farmers monitor vital information like humidity, air temperature and soil quality using remote sensors. This project helps farmers improve yield, plan more efficient irrigation and make harvest forecasts. It also helps biologists study the effects of genomes and microclimates on crop production.<br>
                        <b>Transportation: </b>
                        IoT is making self-driving and/or connected cars a reality. Automotive industry leaders such as BMW, Ford and GM and newer entrants in the auto space like Google, Local Motors and Uber are announcing and deploying innovative technologies to support connected car platforms. These automotive IoT initiatives promise to save lives, reduce pollution and commute hassles and simplify transportation for millions around the globe.<br>
